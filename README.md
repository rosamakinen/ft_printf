# ft_printf
Program that imitates the functionality of C library function called printf. With this project I learned more about variadic functions and
how to compose a more delicate C program, with a more clear file structure. 

It will handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%

• %c Prints a single character.
• %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
• %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
• %i Prints an integer in base 10.
• %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
• %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
• %% Prints a percent sign.

This function should work as 'the normal' printf does.
